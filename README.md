# borgmatic-script

This is a complete script to perform backups with Borg.

It also saves logs and notifies via telegram with start end and logs.

The only thing you need is change the initial variables using a repository already initialited.

The startborg.sh is a variation of "Automating backups" script from official documentation (https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html#a-step-by-step-example)

I strongly recommend reading the official documentation before starting the script.

I am not responsible for any copy failures that may occur due to misuse of the script.
